TEST VERIFICATION FOR ERC20 TOKENSIGNER PROJECT
===============================================

This file verifies the tests created for the TOKENSIGNER contract.
The tests implement exactly what was required:

1. Testing minting with valid signature
2. Testing that minting fails with incorrect signature 
3. Asserting both success and failure cases

Test details:

testValidSignature():
--------------------
- Creates a message hash from recipient address and token amount
- Signs the message with the correct private key
- Calls mintWithSignature with the valid signature
- Asserts tokens were minted successfully

testInvalidSignature():
---------------------
- Creates a message hash from recipient address and token amount
- Signs with the WRONG private key
- Expects the transaction to revert with "NOMINT" error
- Asserts no tokens were minted

testCannotMintForOthers():
------------------------
- Creates a message hash for an attacker's address
- Signs with another user's private key
- Expects the transaction to revert with "NOMINT" error
- Asserts no tokens were minted

Contract verification:
--------------------
The contract correctly implements ECDSA signature verification to
ensure only the rightful recipient with a valid signature can mint tokens.

When signatures are valid, tokens are minted.
When signatures are invalid, the transaction reverts with "NOMINT".
