"Build a Solidity smart contract for a staking system where users can stake tokens and earn rewards over time. The contract should include the following features:

// Users can deposit (stake) ERC20 tokens into the contract.
// The contract should track each user's staked amount and staking duration.
// Rewards should be calculated based on the staking period and distributed accordingly.
// Users should be able to withdraw their stake along with earned rewards after a minimum staking period.
// Ensure the contract is gas-efficient and secure against potential vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks." Would you like me to add extra requirements or provide a sample template to guide them? ðŸš€
