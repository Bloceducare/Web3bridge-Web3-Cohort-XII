Detailed Component Explanation
1. Contract Structure & Inheritance

Inherits from ReentrancyGuard for protection against reentrancy attacks
Inherits from Ownable for administrative functions
Uses OpenZeppelin's IERC20 interface for token interactions

2. Key State Variables

s_stakingToken: The token users can stake
s_rewardsToken: The token given as rewards
s_totalSupply: Total amount of tokens staked
stakingStart: Tracks when each user started staking
s_balances: Maps user addresses to their staked amounts
s_rewards: Tracks pending rewards for each user

3. Constants

REWARD_RATE: Fixed reward rate per second (100)
MINIMUM_STAKING_PERIOD: Required staking duration (1 day)
MAX_REWARD_RATE: Cap on reward rate (1000)

4. Core Functions
Staking Process
solidityCopyfunction stake(uint256 amount)

Validates amount is > 0
Updates reward calculations
Increases total supply and user balance
Records staking start time
Transfers tokens from user to contract
Emits Staked event

Withdrawal Process
solidityCopyfunction withdraw(uint256 amount)

Checks minimum staking period
Updates rewards
Decreases total supply and user balance
Transfers tokens back to user
Emits Withdrawn event

Reward Claiming
solidityCopyfunction claimReward()

Updates reward calculations
Transfers earned rewards
Resets user's reward balance
Emits RewardsClaimed event

5. Safety Features
Reentrancy Protection

Uses OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
All state changes before external calls
nonReentrant modifier on critical functions

Emergency Features
solidityCopyfunction emergencyWithdraw()

Allows withdrawal during emergencies
Bypasses staking period check
Only available when emergencyStop is active

Input Validation

moreThanZero modifier
Transfer success checks
Minimum staking period enforcement

6. Reward Calculation
solidityCopyfunction rewardPerToken()

Calculates rewards based on:

Time elapsed since last update
Total staked tokens
Reward rate


Uses 18 decimal precision

7. Admin Controls

Emergency stop functionality
Owned by deployer
Configurable parameters
